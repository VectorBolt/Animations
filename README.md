# Animations

This repo is the code used to generate animations for my YouTube channel [VectorBolt](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN3uzbzGgzp75Cl2Ai73QSA). 

The scenes were generated using the animation library [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), created by Grant Sanderson from [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw).
Note that these code files use the original [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) repo by [3b1b](https://github.com/3b1b); I have not switched to the [community-maintained version](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/) yet.
